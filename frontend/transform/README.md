#Tranforming Datacube pbf to Vector tiles

Install with `npm install`
run with `gulp`

To test serve using `http-server ./dist`
Notice that it requires http-server to be installed globally.
Alternatively 
`node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server ./dist`

The idea it to use it where Vector tiles is expected and use this to transform and use the existing pipeline.
