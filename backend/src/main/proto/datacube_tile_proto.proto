/**
 * A basic tile with a set of channels for x,y located pixels.
 * The data channel must the same length as the pixels so that the data matches the pixel - that is, the
 * channel data item at index 0 represents the data for the pixel defined by the pixel indexed at x[0] and y[0].
 *
 * This is a simple tile used only for demonstration purposes.  Changes to make:
 *  i.   Make the pixels relative to the previous (improves compression)
 *  ii.  Support necessary metadata for channels
 *  iii. Review all types and ensure the smallest is used (are uint32 the smallest?)
 *  iv.  ZigZag encode if needed
